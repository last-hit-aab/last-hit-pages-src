# Learn Last-Hit
People come to Last-Hit from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.

- If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/).
- If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our [guide to main concepts](/main-concepts/).

Like any unfamiliar technology, Last-Hit does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.

## Quick Start
The [quick start](/quick-start/) contains a very simple startup example.

## Tutorial
If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/). In this tutorial, we record and replay a yandex search page. You might be tempted to skip it because it's very simple — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to use Last-Hit apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.

## Continuous Integration
[Coninuous integration](/ci/) is the most important part in software building process, we just focus on the UI automation CI part. 

# Thinking in Last-Hit
Many Last-Hit users credit reading [Thinking in Last-Hit](/thinking-in-last-hit/) as the moment Last-Hit finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably Last-Hit providing a new perspective on UI automation test works.

# Advanced Concepts
Once you’re comfortable with the main concepts and played with Last-Hit a little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to the powerful, but less commonly used Last-Hit features like [Centralized Admin Server](/admin-server/) and [Data Matrix](/data-matrix/).
