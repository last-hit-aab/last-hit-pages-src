<p class="sub-title">This page is introducing flow dependency and paramterization.</p>

# Dependency
Flow can depend on another flow, by flow settings,

![Flow Dependency](./dependency.png)

> Loop dependency is not allowed.

## Force Dependency
When a flow force depends on another flow, 
- Start step of current flow is ignored
- End step of depended flow is ignored
- On record, steps of depended flow are replayed first, then start to record
- On replay, steps of depended flow are replayed first, then steps of current flow are replayed

> A login flow might be depended by many flows.

## Soft Dependency

> **Coming soon.**

# Parameterization
Parameterization is a very important feature of flow.

There are 3 types of parameter:
- `in`: as input parameter only
- `out`: as output parameter only
- `both`: both for input and output parameter

Parameters are defined in parameters dialog,

![Parameters](./parameter.png)

Input parameter can be used on step,

![Parameters In Step](./parameter-in-step.png)

- By syntax `${}`, in this case it is `${searchKey}`
- Multiple parameters for one property is supported, such as `${searchKey1}-${searchKey2}`

> Only works on `value`.
